Here are some efficiency-boosting scripts or functions for **Robotics** applications. Some functions are based on Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox. 

## UR5Tools
These functions provides convenient ways to help users to study the Universal Robot 5. Some of these functions are based on Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox.

## UR5VREPTools
These functions or scripts are based on the V-REP's remote API (MATLAB). By these scripts and functions, users are given access to UR5's handles, motion planning and so forth in a pretty simple style. 

Note that if you use these functions or scripts you must not change the default names of UR5 and its children models.

## RG2VREPTools
These functions are based on the V-REP's remote API (MATLAB). Now these functions only provide users with very simple ways to open or close the RG2 in V-REP scene.

Note that if you use these functions or scripts you must not change the default names of RG2 and its children models.

## RigidBodyTools
These functions are used for simplify rigid body transformation in MATLAB. Most of these functions are based on Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox. 

## PlotTools
A very simple way to plot your x,y,z data in the MATLAB figure.
